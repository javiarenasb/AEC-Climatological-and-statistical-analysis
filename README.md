Hi, in this project I made a climatological and statistical analysis of Brazil. The initial objective was to find clues or factors that indicate a South American monsoon.
Before starting, I researched typical monsoons that occur in the eastern side of the world, to have references for the conditions, which led me to identify the most
important variables at play, these are:

-Temperature
-Wind
-Superficial Pressure
-Precipitation
-Convective Precipitation

Data were downloaded from Era5 for the period of time since 1994 to 2024 in NetCDF format. I divided the data into two semesters of the year, from december to march and
from april to november, with the purpose of determinig if the country has the conditions for summer and winter monsoons (with summer monsoon being rainier). 

I developed different statistical techniques:

1) Mean calculation to determine total annual precipitation and then compare how much of it was convective, and know in what semester it is rainier.
2) Correlation analysis between convective precipitation and surface pressure to look for some patterns.
3) Graphing the direction and intensity of the wind to searching for differences in both semesters.

Precipitation graphics show that the average annual precipitation is almost 1600 mm, whose approximately is 70% convective, besides proves that during the summer season 
there is more precipitation compared to the rest of the year.

In the correlation results, I found an essential unstable band, SACZ  ¨South Atlantic Convergence Zone¨, which regulates the weather in Brazil. 

It is necessary to inspect on direction and intensity figures, by zooming in diverses zones we can notice the trade winds in the northwest, and in the Amazon, a 
tendency for winds to form vortices in summer, which could indicate the presence of monsoon on this place.
